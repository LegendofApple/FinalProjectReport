Abstract
In this paper, we explore the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
for generating realistic images similar to those found in the FashionMNIST dataset.
To achieve this, we implement a GAN using PyTorch, consisting of a generator
and a discriminator network. The generator, which takes random noise as input,
produces synthetic images, while the discriminator attempts to differentiate between
real and generated images. We train the GAN using the FashionMNIST dataset
for multiple epochs, evaluating its performance based on the generated image
quality and the discriminator’s classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate
the GAN’s ability to generate realistic images that closely resemble the original
dataset, highlighting its potential for various applications in the computer vision
domain.
